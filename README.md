## Setup
Usage of Python 3 is required. It can be installed [on Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
```
# Optional but recommended:
python3 -m venv env; source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
./manage.py server # or `FLASK_APP=manage FLASK_ENV=development flask run`
```
## Running

```
# Development
# If using a virtual env: source env/bin/activate
./manage.py resetdb # to seed data

# Go to localhost:5000 in a browser and click on Login
# Login with the following credentials "user@example.com", "test

# Production documentation in the repository.
```


## Testing

Github Actions is configured to run tests and produce code coverage metrics.

To run tests locally, try this command:
```
APPNAME_ENV=test ./manage.py test --coverage
```

### Local Secrets

To configure OAuth login and Stripe billing in development, you will need to set some environment variables. See `.env.local.sample` for an example.

```bash
cp .env.local.sample .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Stripe & Google test keys
source .env.local
flask run
```

You may also want to change some of the constants in `appname.constants`


## Deployment

Ignite is not tied to a specific platform for deployment, but it works well on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) and [Dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/) with minimal configuration.

It is also designed to work well on other cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and DigitalOcean.

Documentation is currently provided for installations on Dokku.


## Stripe Webhooks Locally


- Install the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)
- Login to the Stripe CLI (`stripe login`)
- Run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/webhooks/stripe`
- Use the webhook secret and configure your app to use it (`export STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...`)
- To replay an event in a seperate console: `stripe events resend evt_XYZ`
